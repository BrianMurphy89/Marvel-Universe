# Marvel-Universe

This page has been created to provide information on both heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe.

Marvel Studios for the past 10 years has been working on developing characters on the cinematic stage and intertwining their stories together with the end goal of releasing Marvel's Infinity War.  Due this, it can be complicated for the casual fan to understand everything that is going on. The information that is provided on this web app is meant to only be informative!

Eventually, I would love to turn this site into a location for fans to come and comment on their favorite characters, provide suggestions for the site and turn into a forum for Marvel fans to communicate.
